# Voice Transformer Architecture

## System Overview

The Voice Transformer application follows a modular pipeline architecture with four main components:

```
[Audio Input] → [Audio Processing] → [Voice Transformation] → [Audio Output]
```

## Components

### 1. Audio Input Module
- Captures real-time audio from microphone (built-in or external)
- Samples audio at 16kHz, 16-bit depth, mono channel
- Processes audio in chunks of 512 samples (32ms) for low latency
- Implements buffering to handle varying processing speeds

### 2. Audio Processing Module
- Performs preprocessing on raw audio (normalization, noise reduction)
- Converts time-domain signals to frequency-domain using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)
- Extracts fundamental frequency and spectral features
- Prepares data for the voice transformation model

### 3. Voice Transformation Module
- Uses RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion) model
- Transforms voice characteristics from male to female range
- Preserves speech content and intonation patterns
- Maintains natural Vietnamese language phonetics and tones
- Optimized for minimal processing time

### 4. Audio Output Module
- Reconstructs time-domain signal from transformed features
- Handles audio playback with minimal buffer size
- Synchronizes input and output timing to prevent audio drift
- Implements smooth transitions between audio chunks

## Data Flow

1. Microphone captures audio and delivers it to the application in chunks
2. Each chunk undergoes preprocessing and feature extraction
3. The RVC model transforms the voice characteristics
4. Transformed audio is reconstructed and sent to output device
5. Process repeats with new audio chunks

## Technical Considerations

### Latency Management
- Target end-to-end latency: <100ms for natural conversation
- Audio chunk size: 32ms (512 samples at 16kHz)
- Processing optimizations to keep transformation time <50ms per chunk
- Buffer management to handle processing time variations

### Memory Management
- Circular buffer for audio input/output
- Efficient tensor operations for model inference
- Minimize memory allocations during real-time processing

### Error Handling
- Graceful recovery from audio device disconnections
- Monitoring for processing delays with adaptive buffer sizing
- Fallback to pass-through mode if transformation fails
